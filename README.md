# 💉 COVID-19 Vaccinations vs Deaths Analysis Using SQL

This is a short data analysis project using SQL to explore the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations and deaths in the United States. The project uses two large datasets obtained from [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/), focusing on insights from the pandemic era.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze trends and relationships between COVID-19 vaccination rates and reported deaths, using SQL queries to clean, join, and explore the datasets.

## 🗃️ Datasets Used

- **COVID-19 Vaccination Data** – includes daily and cumulative vaccination statistics by state.
- **COVID-19 Death Data** – includes daily reported deaths by state.

## ⚙️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- 📄 SQL (joins, CTEs, aggregations, filtering)
- 🔍 Data cleaning and preparation
- 📈 Data-driven storytelling through query-based analysis

## 🔍 Key Analysis Highlights

- Comparison of vaccination rates vs death rates across different U.S. states
- Identification of patterns during peak vaccination periods
- Time-based trends in deaths following large-scale vaccinations
- Insights on whether higher vaccination coverage correlated with lower mortality
